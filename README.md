First, I approached this project by getting down to the basics such as creating the HTML, like the form, and then the JavaScript, creating any variables needed for my project. I left the CSS for last and as I code along because there was nothing to be done to it in the beginning. As I went along coding this project I ran into a couple of logical errors such as the difference between assigning the button HTML element’s type attribute as “submit” or as “button.” This can cause the live server to immediately reload after the button is clicked depending on what it is assigned. After the first day I was able to look over any part of the project I did not know exactly how to code and then go back using my new knowledge and fix it. For example, I did not know how I would add the date for each task when it is submitted but I was able to research and learn how to add it then go back and code it using the new things I learned. Overall, this project has helped me learn a lot on how to code using a mixture of different things that we have learned throughout this course.
